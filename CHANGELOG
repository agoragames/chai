0.3.7
=====

* Fixed teardown of __new__ on types that overload the method

0.3.6
=====

* Fix logic of raising UnexpectedCall when calling a stub and an unclosed, 
  non-matching, in-order expectation does not have its counts met

0.3.5
=====

* Only close a non-matching expectation if its counts have been met, else 
  it's an UnexpectedCall

0.3.4
=====

* Removed termcolor requirement. Both termcolor and unittest2 are optional.

0.3.3
=====

* Removed unittest2 requirement, fixes https://github.com/agoragames/chai/issues/5

0.3.2
=====

* Expectations with a type argument are matched against either an instance 
  of that type, or the type itself

0.3.1
=====

* Further fixed global namespace manipulation on test class hierarchies

0.3.0
=====

* Improve iterative expectations by not insisting that one knows how many
  times an expectation will be called unless explicitly set
* Assume any arguments on an expectation unless explicitly set
* Fixed stubbing properties on an instance

0.2.4
=====

* Fixes bug in stubs on types by preventing secondary initialization

0.2.3
=====

* Mock objects report parameters and method name when raising UnexpectedCall
* Fixed global namespace manipulation on deeply nested Chai subclasses

0.2.2
=====

* UnexpectedCall is now a BaseException which is re-raised as an AssertionError 
in Chai metaclass `test_wrapper` method. This decreases the chance that 
UnexpectedCall will be caught by the application code being tested.

0.2.1
=====

* Allow variables in returns(), effectively treating the variable as a regex capture.

0.2.0
=====

* Merge pull request to close issue #2

0.1.23
======

* side_effect is passed the arguments of the expectation if it doesn't define
its own arguments

0.1.22
======

* side_effect takes arguments after the method to eliminate need for a lambda

0.1.21
======

* Fixed a bug with (un)stubbing of a module attribute which is really a classmethod
* Added support for `with` statement on expectations, see README for usage
* Fixed (un)stubbing of methods originally defined on `object` class

0.1.20
======

* Added __eq__ to all comparators so that they can be used inside data structures.

0.1.19
======

* Fixed failure to teardown stub on __new__ after `expect(type)`

0.1.18
======

* Simplified stubbing of object creation, so that `expect(type)` can be used as
  if it was mocking __init__, but return an object as if it was mocking __new__.

0.1.17
======

* Fix edge case where an attribute might not be defined on a class when
  calling stub(obj, 'attr').

0.1.16
======

* Added Mock.__nonzero__ to re-support "if exists" code, which was broken by
  the addition of Mock.__len__.

0.1.15
======

* Added container and context manager interfaces to Mock object

0.1.14
======

* Added 'any_args' expectation modifier and 'like' comparator. See documentaion
  for details.

0.1.13
======

* Added 'var' comparator for ability to assert that the same argument was used
  for one or more expectations, and then to fetch the variable after the call
  and run assertions on it. See documentation for details.

0.1.12
======

* Added teardown() expectation modifier to allow for removing a stub after
  it has been met

0.1.11
======

* Support stubbing of built-in functions and methods

0.1.10
======

* Support stubbing of functions if they have a module context

0.1.9
=====

* Much nicer output from expectations
* Coloring output

0.1.8
=====

* Support stubbing of get, set and delete on class properties through both 
  attribute name and object reference
* Improved output on unmet expectations
* Changelog
